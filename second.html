    <b>2. write a bref history of JavaScript that covers all version up to ECMA6</b>
    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

        It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
        
        After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop 
        JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).</p>
